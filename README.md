# Brief description of the project

The project involves the development of a granular synthesizer using Supercollider for sound design.

It demonstrates how granular synthesis can be used to create immersive soundscapes from completely different audio sources and how randomness 
can be exploited in grain selection to achieve non-repetitive results. 

Overall, the project provides valuable insights into the principles and applications of granular synthesis and demonstrates 
the potential of Supercollider for creating complex and realistic sound designs.
